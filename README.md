# Website

Just borrowed a template off of [HTML5 UP!](https://html5up.net/) and coded my own [typing animation](assets/js/typing.js) in Javascript.

The site said I needed attribution and I wasn't sure how to go about doing that... so I just left the given [readme](README.txt) and [license](LICENSE.txt) in the repo.

Used particles from [particles.js](https://marcbruederlin.github.io/particles.js/).
